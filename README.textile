h1. Functional workshop

This is the source code for a workshop created by Fredrik Vraalsen and Alf Kristian St√∏yle who work for Knowit AS.

Its meaning is to learn Java devs what functional programming is all about. It is introductory, and it is meant to take about 4 hours to complete.

We have currently not published the slides yet, but they will most likely be put out somewhere as well.
